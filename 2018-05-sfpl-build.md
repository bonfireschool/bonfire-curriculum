The [Business, Science and Technology Desk of San Francisco Public Library](http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=0200001701) and [Bonfire School](http://bonfireschool.com/) present*Learn, Design and Build Software*Build software with Python==========================Software can be hard to understand. It’s harder still to make software. This class aims to make learning with an industry professional fun and engaging. Through a series of group exercises we will think about the needs of others and how we can solve their problems with software.There are five classes in this series, starting during *Connect with Tech Week*!<div style="height: 1.5em;"></div>

Ice Breakers------------If you arrive early with other students, ask your neighbor:- What do you expect to learn today?- Why did you come to this class?- What programming have you done?- How did you get here today?About the Instructor--------------------[Louis Rawlins](http://louisrawlins.com/) is an artist and engineer building community in health and design. For over a decade, he has designed and built websites and mobile apps for Silicon Valley companies. Louis founded [Bonfire School](http://bonfireschool.com/) for people of any background to create what they want &ndash; crafts, software, dance and more &ndash; in a place that supports personal health. He dreams that it can become a physical school one day.
If you have feedback or questions after the class, please email [louis@bonfireschool.com](mailto:"louis@bonfireschool.com")

About the Crew--------------------[Greg Gorlen](https://hills.ccsf.edu/~ggorlen/) supports students during class and is a youth programming instructor in San Francisco.

[Dima Gavrysh](http://www.dimagavrysh.com) is documentary photographer here to capture the essence of our class so we can learn together for future classes.

[Dany Qumsiyeh](https://qhex.org) is an engineer and intructor, and is here to observe our class for feedback.Mindful Moment--------------Let's take a breath for clarity to see how we are doing and what we will do next.Group Introductions-------------------Your instructor has lived in San Francisco for fourteen years.Where are you from? What would you like to learn?<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
How Computers Work------------------Before we start, it's good to review how computers work. Programming can be difficult because the computer system is built upon the work of many different parts that aid to *remove complexity* when we use these computers.As a result, when we are programming a computer to do something for us, we must know exactly what the system expects, the inputs and outputs to the system, as well as some knowledge about how the computer stores information.Knowing how the computer works helps us build the right thing for the right person > **[How Computers Work: The CPU and Memory](http://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/wolfe/book/Readings/Reading04.htm)**Introduction to Python----------------------**Python Interpreter**We will be using the Python REPL, which stands for read-eval-print loop. You can think of it as a command prompt that allow your computer to read input, evaluate it and then show you the result on the screen. That is the basic concept.> **[Python 3 REPL](https://repl.it/languages/python3)****What's an interpreted language?**Python is an interpreted language. As a gross over-generalization, we can think of programming language as having several layers:- Interpreted languages (like JavaScript, Python) are expressive because they use patterns that closely resemble English. Commands can generally be run immediately without being compiled.- Compiled languages (like Java, C++) are expressive but must be compiled to run on a computer.- Assembly language is an arcane, but expressive language for programming directly to a computer. It offers shortcuts to store data in memory registers and control how the program will run on a computer.- Machine code is the information that controls how the program will run on a computer.<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Gopher------Our code example is inspired by [Gopher](http://www.brebru.com/isgopher2.html) which is a technology that came before the web. The aim of our program is to be simple and clear for people that want to find information. We will be using computers for what they are good at &ndash; storing and finding information.Programming in Python---------------------Use this code [Python Code for SFPL - 2017-03](https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/resources/2017-03-sfpl-build-code.py) at repl.it (see above). 
<img src="https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/images/person-a.svg" alt="alt text" width="50px" style="vertical-align:middle"><img src="https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/images/person-b.svg" alt="alt text" width="50px" style="vertical-align:middle">**Pair up with another student**- **Person A** is driver- **Person B** is navigator**Finding Books**Pair up with another student. One of you can 'drive' and write code while the other person 'navigates' by calling out things you're looking for or might have missed. Working together facilitates learning because computer programming is a complex subject. Don't worry, you'll have time to work on your own as well.Load the program from and look through the code and see what you can learn.Change the program to learn to new things. See what removing and adding code does to the output on your screen.**Concepts to Consider**
- Why would we want to print?
- What is a variable or a type? What does it mean to assign or compare something?
- How would you define a list? When we put something in a list, how do we get it back?
- What "conditionals" do we use everyday when we speak?
- Why are functions important? How do we use them now and how could we use them through the program we are building?<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Keep Working Together---------------------**After 15 minutes, switch roles**
- **Person B** is driver- **Person A** is navigatorConsider the questions on the previous page. Expand on what you have learned.

What would you need to update the program:

- ...to find the author of a book?
- ...to add search for book names?
- ...to add books to the list?

After we are done building and changing software in Python, reflect on what you did one your own and as a group. What was surprising? What was difficult?Professional Context--------------------Bringing these skills together, we can start to understand the role of a software engineer. These skills help us learn how to express human needs as software, but we still need feedback about how well our software is working.What does it mean to build software for human needs? When can you use these skills? How can it be useful?Class Reflection----------------What worked and what would you change? Let's improve together.<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
