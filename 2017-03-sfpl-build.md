The [Business, Science and Technology Deskof San Francisco Public Library](http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=0200001701) and [Bonfire School](http://bonfireschool.com/) present*Learn, Design and Build Software*Build software with Python==========================Software can be hard to understand. It’s harder still to make software. This class aims to make learning with an industry professional fun and engaging. Through a series of group exercises we will think about the needs of others and how we can solve their problems with software.There are three main concepts in this series, each with it’s own class!**March 15th: [Learn to find human needs for software](2017-03-sfpl-learn.md)*** Listen and spend time with others to know what people need**March 22nd: [Design software based on human needs](2017-03-sfpl-design.md)*** Draw pictures and tell a story of what to build to meet those needs**March 29th: [Build software with Python using design](2017-03-sfpl-build.md)*** Code software and change it until it meets the needs of others	**Location:**	San Francisco Public Library	Computer Training Center	5th Floor, Main Library	(415) 557-4388* * *Ice Breakers------------If you arrive early with other students, ask your neighbor:- What do you expect to learn today?- Why did you come to this class?- What programming have you done?- How did you get here today?About the Instructor--------------------[Louis Rawlins](http://louisrawlins.com/) is a writer and technologist building community in design and health. For the past decade, he designed mobile apps and built websites in Silicon Valley. Louis founded [Bonfire School](http://bonfireschool.com/) for people of any background to create what they want &ndash; crafts, software, dance and more &ndash; in a place that supports personal health. He dreams that it can become a physical school one day. Louis is excited to teach a public class in San Francisco, a city that has inspired him since he arrived in 2004.If you have feedback or questions after the class, please email [louis@bonfireschool.com](mailto:"louis@bonfireschool.com")Mindful Moment--------------Let's take a breath for clarity to see how we are doing and what we will do next.Group Introductions-------------------Your instructor has lived in San Francisco for twelve years.Where are you from? What would you like to learn?# SORRY, THIS CLASS IS NOT YET COMPLETE.Professional Context--------------------Bringing these skills together, we can start to understand the role of a software design researcher. These skills help us learn how to find human needs and can give us feedback about how well our software is working.What does it mean to build software for human needs? When can you use these skills? How can it be useful?Class Reflection----------------What worked and what would you change? Let's improve together.Recommended Reading-------------------*Learn to find human needs*- [Interviewing Users](http://www.portigal.com/Books/interviewing-users/) by Steve Portigal (2013)- [Rocket Surgery Made Easy](http://www.sensible.com/rsme.html) by Steve Krug (2010)*Design software*- [Lean UX](http://www.jeffgothelf.com/lean-ux-book/) by Jeff Gothelf with Josh Seiden (2013)- [The User’s Journey](http://www.donnalichaw.com/the-users-journey/) by Donna Lichaw (2016)- [Design Is a Job](https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job) by Mike Monteiro (2012)*Build software with Python*- [Think Python 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) – Green Tea Press- [Think Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025696.do) by Allen B Downey (2015) [Print Version]- [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3) - Python3 Compiler- [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) — Python 3 documentation---**Copyright 2017 Bonfire School****For use of curriculum, contact author [louis@bonfireschool.com](mailto:"louis@bonfireschool.com") for permission.**<img src="https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/images/bonfireschool-logotype.svg" alt="alt text" width="160px" style="vertical-align:middle">
