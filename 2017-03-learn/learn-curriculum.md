# Bonfire School Curriculum

Introduction to the purpose of this class.



It's a series:

Learn, Design and Build Software!
---------------------------------
###[Learn]()

###[Design]()

###[Build]()



Ice Breakers
------------

Ask your neighbor:

- What do you expect to learn today?
- Why did you come to this class?
- What programming have you done?
- How did you get here today?


Mindful Moment
--------------

Taking a break gives us clarity to connect to what we are doing.


Introductions
-------------

I'm from San Francisco and I've worked in Silicon Valley for the past ten years. Where are you from? What would you like to learn?


Discount Usability
------------------

How do people use software? Let's find out!

**Get into groups of 3 - 5 people.**

What we will do:

- watch someone use a computer
- ask them to speak aloud
- take notes
- see what you learn

**Task 1: Download epub version of "Interviewing Users by Steve Portigal" from the San Francisco Public Library website (sfpl.org) onto your computer.**

**Task 2: Read online version of "Think Python by Allen B Downey" on the San Francisco Public Library website (sfpl.org).**

While you are observing these tasks:

- look for confusion or frustration
- look for surprise or joy
- look for moments of clarity


Short Break
-----------

Stay nearby, but get up and move around. Get a drink of water. We'll start again in 10 minutes.


Interviewing People
-------------------

We want to interview people to understand how they see the world and the software they are using. We want to learn what they are trying to get done and what work for them today. We will use a general example to understand how to interview someone.

Demonstration:

- talk to people to learn more
- listen to their inflection
- notice body language
- understand what's being shared

**Get into groups of 3 people.**

First interview session:

- *Person A* is listener
- *Person B* is speaker
- *Person C* is scribe

After each session, you switch roles until everyone has a chance to be interviewed.

Each session looks like:

- task (2 minutes): listener asks speaker question, scribe writes on post-its
- (record story, then stop)
- task (1 minutes): scribe tells story back to speaker
- (tell story, then stop)
- task (1 minutes): reflect as a group
    - what was a surprise?
    - what was difficult?


Professional Context
--------------------

How are these skills useful at work? When and where can they be used? How does it help us build software for human needs and what does that even mean?


Class Reflection
----------------

What worked and what would you change? We can improve together.
