Why Writing Well is Important
-----------------------------

John Maeda quote.

Something from clarity and grace.

Possibly, something from Donald M Murray.

Technology in Context
---------------------

Inmates running the asylum -- alan cooper, design, personas, user stories

Agile versus Waterfall. Over the next two classes, we'll look at the **Big Picture** of writing for design, as well as **Stories** that help communicate how we can build the right software for people.

Big Picture: Part 1 of 2, June 6
----------------------------

In order to get a sense of what it's like to write for design, we start by looking at examples. By far the easiest contemporary challenge in mobile design is the "first time experience".

https://blog.usejournal.com/ftue-first-time-user-experience-to-rule-the-world-69de5c196393

The question to be answered is this:

How do we help someone new to our app understand how to get oriented and do what they came to do?

This question has embedded assumptions around ***activation***, ***retention***, ***referral*** and ultimately ***revenue***. Which is to say, if someone can't figure out how to sign-up or use your service properly, they are likely to leave, likely to say bad things (or at least nothing) to their friends about your service and thus impact the ability for your service to make money.

The easiest way to keep people happy with any service you provide is to learn how to communicate clearly through design, which includes the written word.

###Content Strategy

Modern software development teams have content strategist that work with, or on, the software design team. Their role is to enable people to think about language and communication. Frequently, people come to content strategy from professions like journalism, where concise communication is valued.

###Warm-Up (Big Picture)

Follow each of these prompts in timed sequence:

- **For three minutes,** write as many subject-verb-object sentences as you can.
- **For five minutes,** write a series of linking sentences until time is up.
- **For ten minutes,** write one long, continuous run-on sentence.

>Sometimes, the more constraints we give ourselves, the more fun we can have.
>Think about the rules of a sport or a game: while a free-for-all may sound like fun, we often prefer to have rules and guidelines, and to see how much creativity and mastery we can accomplish within those guidelines.
>
> â€” Brenda Miller (exercise credit to the artist and writer Nancy Canyon)

###Example (Big Picture)

First time experience examples.

- What works and why? What is being communicated?
- How might you do this differently?

###Exercise (Big Picture)

Make the 

[+ adjust brief for library app, with screens -- or do I just erase some screens?]

**Design Brief**> San Francisco Public Library patrons want to find books to read on their digital devices. In a world of iPhone, Android devices, tablets and laptops, the library has accumulated books in a variety of digital formats from many services. Finding and reading books online has gotten complicated. Patrons can download books to their computer in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI format. To read these books, they can use services like OverDrive, Axis 360, Hoopla, Safari Online... just to name a few.
> > Your task is to make the process of finding and reading digital books easier. Consider how you can make it clear when a patron has downloaded a book. How can you help people figure out what device they are using and what format is appropriate? Help people through the process and clarify what needs to happen when you can.

Stories: Part 2 of 2, June 20
------------------------------------JOhn Maeda example

Agile and mountain goat


###Warm-Up (Stories)

If you have a sheet of paper, write a sentence in a line across the top and hand it to the person on your left (or behind / in front of you).

If you receive a sheet of paper with a line written on it, write a line that continues the story underneath that line and fold the paper until it hides the previous sentence. Before handing it to the person on your left (or behind / in front of you), ensure that the only sentence you can see if the sentence that you have written.

**After ten minutes,** if you have the paper in your hand, add a final sentence if you have not and then prepare to unfold the paper and read the entire story to the class.

- How was this exercise?
- What can be said about teamwork based on what you read?
- How could you do this differently?

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

###Example (Stories)

What are user stories and how do we use them?

They are a way to describe how a piece of software works and to start a conversation with developers about how to build that application.

Product managers write user stories, but it's good to have the mindset so that you know how your work will be translated as a designer.

###Exercise (Stories)

Let's look at the work we did in the Big Picture session. Each of these screens has navigation that we need to describe in order to build it.

How can we break this down?

Let's try the format:

As a...
I want to...

And,

THEN,

For reference, here is an outline of our needs.

How Computers Work------------------Before we start, it's good to review how computers work. Programming can be difficult because the computer system is built upon the work of many different parts that aid to *remove complexity* when we use these computers.As a result, when we are programming a computer to do something for us, we must know exactly what the system expects, the inputs and outputs to the system, as well as some knowledge about how the computer stores information.Knowing how the computer works helps us build the right thing for the right person > **[How Computers Work: The CPU and Memory](http://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/wolfe/book/Readings/Reading04.htm)**Introduction to Python----------------------**Python Interpreter**We will be using the Python REPL, which stands for read-eval-print loop. You can think of it as a command prompt that allow your computer to read input, evaluate it and then show you the result on the screen. That is the basic concept.> **[Python 3 REPL](https://repl.it/languages/python3)****What's an interpreted language?**Python is an interpreted language. As a gross over-generalization, we can think of programming language as having several layers:- Interpreted languages (like JavaScript, Python) are expressive because they use patterns that closely resemble English. Commands can generally be run immediately without being compiled.- Compiled languages (like Java, C++) are expressive but must be compiled to run on a computer.- Assembly language is an arcane, but expressive language for programming directly to a computer. It offers shortcuts to store data in memory registers and control how the program will run on a computer.- Machine code is the information that controls how the program will run on a computer.<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Gopher------Our code example is inspired by [Gopher](http://www.brebru.com/isgopher2.html) which is a technology that came before the web. The aim of our program is to be simple and clear for people that want to find information. We will be using computers for what they are good at &ndash; storing and finding information.Programming in Python---------------------Use this code [Python Code for SFPL - 2017-03](https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/resources/2017-03-sfpl-build-code.py) at repl.it (see above). 
<img src="https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/images/person-a.svg" alt="alt text" width="50px" style="vertical-align:middle"><img src="https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/images/person-b.svg" alt="alt text" width="50px" style="vertical-align:middle">**Pair up with another student**- **Person A** is driver- **Person B** is navigator**Finding Books**Pair up with another student. One of you can 'drive' and write code while the other person 'navigates' by calling out things you're looking for or might have missed. Working together facilitates learning because computer programming is a complex subject. Don't worry, you'll have time to work on your own as well.Load the program from and look through the code and see what you can learn.Change the program to learn to new things. See what removing and adding code does to the output on your screen.**Concepts to Consider**
- Why would we want to print?
- What is a variable or a type? What does it mean to assign or compare something?
- How would you define a list? When we put something in a list, how do we get it back?
- What "conditionals" do we use everyday when we speak?
- Why are functions important? How do we use them now and how could we use them through the program we are building?<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Keep Working Together---------------------**After 15 minutes, switch roles**
- **Person B** is driver- **Person A** is navigatorConsider the questions on the previous page. Expand on what you have learned.

What would you need to update the program:

- ...to find the author of a book?
- ...to add search for book names?
- ...to add books to the list?
* * *
After we are done building and changing software in Python, reflect on what you did one your own and as a group. What was surprising? What was difficult?Professional Context--------------------Bringing these skills together, we can start to understand the role of a software engineer. These skills help us learn how to express human needs as software, but we still need feedback about how well our software is working.What does it mean to build software for human needs? When can you use these skills? How can it be useful?Class Reflection----------------What worked and what would you change? Let's improve together.<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
