The [Business, Science and Technology Desk of San Francisco Public Library](http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=0200001701) and [Bonfire School](http://bonfireschool.com/) present:Writing for Software Design===========================Designing for software is about more than what you can draw and build. Designer tell the story of the people using software and help shape the language used on the interface. In this class, we will explore how to write well and how to offer feedback during the software design process. ###[Writing for Software Design](2018-06-sfpl-write.md)<br />Wednesday, June 6 and June 20<br />6:00pm - 7:30pm

Why Writing Well is Important
-----------------------------

Writing well is important because written language makes up a large part of our waking hours. From advertisements online and outdoors, to email and text messages, our modern lives are filled with words.

As a result, it's important we consider meaning before writing and allow ourselves to communicate clearly, which often means getting out of our own way.

Some thoughts from the book ***Writing to Deadline: The Journalist at Work by Donald M. Murray (2000).***

>***Write Easily***
>
>Forced writing usually sounds like forced writing. Good writing should have the ease of good conversation. Find your way to tell the story without forcing it, letting it appear naturally. To do this you may have to write fast so that you can outrace the censors who live within us all.
>
>To produce writing worth criticism, remember William Stafford's counsel:
>
>>I believe that the so-called "writing block" is a product of some kind of disproportion between your standards and your performance. . . . One should lower his standards until there is no felt threshold to go over in writing. It's easy to write. You just shouldn't have standards that inhibit you from writing.
>>
>>I can imagine a person beginning to feel he's not able to write up to that standard he imagines the world has set for him. But to me that's surrealistic. The only standard I can rationally have is the standard I'm meeting right now. . . . You should be more willing to forgive yourself. It doesn't make any difference if you are good or bad today. The assessment of the product is something that happens after you've done it.


Technology in Context
---------------------

Over the next two classes look at the **Big Picture** of writing for design, as well as **Stories** that help communicate how we can build the right software for people. Primarily we'll be looking at this from the perspective of an "agile development team".

Big Picture: Part 1 of 2, June 6
----------------------------

In order to get a sense of what it's like to write for design, we start by looking at examples. By far the easiest contemporary challenge in mobile design is the "first time experience".

**First Time User Experience**<br />
[https://blog.usejournal.com/ftue-first-time-user-experience-to-rule-the-world-69de5c196393](https://blog.usejournal.com/ftue-first-time-user-experience-to-rule-the-world-69de5c196393)

The question to be answered is this:

>How do we help someone new to our app understand how to get oriented and do what they came to do?

This question has embedded assumptions around ***activation***, ***retention***, ***referral*** and ultimately ***revenue***. Which is to say, if someone can't figure out how to sign-up or use your service properly, they are likely to leave, likely to say bad things (or at least nothing) to their friends about your service and thus impact the ability for your service to make money.

The easiest way to keep people happy with any service you provide is to learn how to communicate clearly through design, which includes the written word.

###Content Strategy

Modern software development teams have content strategist that work with, or on, the software design team. Their role is to enable people to think about language and communication. Frequently, people come to content strategy from professions like journalism, where concise communication is valued.

###Warm-Up (Big Picture)

Follow each of these prompts in timed sequence:

- **For three minutes,** write as many subject-verb-object sentences as you can.
- **For five minutes,** write a series of linking sentences until time is up.
- **For ten minutes,** write one long, continuous run-on sentence.

>Sometimes, the more constraints we give ourselves, the more fun we can have.
>Think about the rules of a sport or a game: while a free-for-all may sound like fun, we often prefer to have rules and guidelines, and to see how much creativity and mastery we can accomplish within those guidelines.
>
> — Brenda Miller (exercise credit to the artist and writer Nancy Canyon)

###Example (Big Picture)

First time experience examples.

- What works and why? What is being communicated?
- How might you do this differently?

###Exercise (Big Picture)

Use the Design Studio for Writing PDF at as a guide for drawing and writing user interface elements based on the design brief below.

**Design Brief**> San Francisco Public Library patrons want to find books to read on their digital devices. In a world of iPhone, Android devices, tablets and laptops, the library has accumulated books in a variety of digital formats from many services. Finding and reading books online has gotten complicated. Patrons can download books to their computer in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI format. To read these books, they can use services like OverDrive, Axis 360, Hoopla, Safari Online... just to name a few.
> > Your task is to make the process of finding and reading digital books easier. Consider how you can make it clear when a patron has downloaded a book. How can you help people figure out what device they are using and what format is appropriate? Help people through the process and clarify what needs to happen when you can.

Stories: Part 2 of 2, June 20
------------------------------------
###Warm-Up (Stories)

If you have a sheet of paper, write a sentence in a line across the top and hand it to the person on your left (or behind / in front of you).

If you receive a sheet of paper with a line written on it, write a line that continues the story underneath that line and fold the paper until it hides the previous sentence. Before handing it to the person on your left (or behind / in front of you), ensure that the only sentence you can see if the sentence that you have written.

**After ten minutes,** if you have the paper in your hand, add a final sentence if you have not and then prepare to unfold the paper and read the entire story to the class.

- How was this exercise?
- What can be said about teamwork based on what you read?
- How could you do this differently?

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

###Example (Stories)

What are user stories and how do we use them?

*A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.*

**Stories are placeholders for future discussion.**

They are a way to describe how a piece of software works and to start a conversation with developers about how to build that application.

Product managers frequently write user stories, but it's good to have the mindset so that you know how your work will be translated as a designer.

As an example:
>Shopper Steve should be able to remove items from his shopping cart 

This can be written as:
>As a shopper<br />
>I want to remove items from my cart<br />
>Because I want to manage items before I check out

Which can be translated to:
>GIVEN I'm a shopper viewing my shopping cart<br />
>WHEN I click the “remove” icon next to an item<br />
>THEN that item should be removed from my cart

###Exercise (Stories)

Let's look at the work we did in the Big Picture session. Each of these screens has navigation that we need to describe in order to build it.

How can we break this down?

For reference, here is an outline of our needs.

Help people through the process and clarify what needs to happen when you can.Professional Context--------------------Bringing these skills together, we can start to understand the role of design in software engineering. These skills help us learn how to express human needs as software requirements and the beginning of conversations for feedback about how well our software meets people's needs.What does it mean to build software for human needs? When can you use these skills? How can it be useful?
Class Reflection----------------What worked and what would you change? Let's improve together.<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
