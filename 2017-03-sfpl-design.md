The [Business, Science and Technology Desk of San Francisco Public Library](http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=0200001701) and [Bonfire School](http://bonfireschool.com/) present*Learn, Design and Build Software*Design software===============Software can be hard to understand. It’s harder still to make software. This class aims to make learning with an industry professional fun and engaging. Through a series of group exercises we will think about the needs of others and how we can solve their problems with software.There are three main concepts in this series, each with it’s own class!**March 15th: [Learn to find human needs for software](2017-03-sfpl-learn.md)*** Listen and spend time with others to know what people need**March 22nd: [Design software based on human needs](2017-03-sfpl-design.md)*** Draw pictures and tell a story of what to build to meet those needs**March 29th: [Build software with Python using design](2017-03-sfpl-build.md)*** Code software and change it until it meets the needs of others	**Location:**	San Francisco Public Library	Computer Training Center	5th Floor, Main Library	(415) 557-4388* * *Ice Breakers------------If you arrive early with other students, ask your neighbor:- What do you expect to learn today?- Why did you come to this class?- What programming have you done?- How did you get here today?About the Instructor--------------------[Louis Rawlins](http://louisrawlins.com/) is a writer and technologist building community in design and health. For the past decade, he designed mobile apps and built websites in Silicon Valley. Louis founded [Bonfire School](http://bonfireschool.com/) for people of any background to create what they want &ndash; crafts, software, dance and more &ndash; in a place that supports personal health. He dreams that it can become a physical school one day. Louis is excited to teach a public class in San Francisco, a city that has inspired him since he arrived in 2004.If you have feedback or questions after the class, please email [louis@bonfireschool.com](mailto:"louis@bonfireschool.com")Mindful Moment--------------Let's take a breath for clarity to see how we are doing and what we will do next.Group Introductions-------------------Your instructor has lived in San Francisco for twelve years.Where are you from? What would you like to learn?Design Studio-------------When we build software, we want to build the right thing for the right person. One of the best approaches to doing that is a combination of drawing and storytelling. Anyone can do it and we'll see how.Responding to a "design brief" that outlines our problem to solve, we will work individually and together to come up with solutions.**Design Brief**> San Francisco Public Library patrons want to find books to read on their digital devices. In a world of iPhone, Android devices, tablets and laptops, the library has accumulated books in a variety of digital formats from many services. Finding and reading books online has gotten complicated. Patrons can download books to their computer in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI format. To read these books, they can use services like OverDrive, Axis 360, Hoopla, Safari Online... just to name a few.> Your task is to make the process of finding and reading digital books easier. Consider how you can make it clear when a patron has downloaded a book. How can you help people figure out what device they are using and what format is appropriate? Help people through the process and clarify what needs to happen when you can.We will use the [Design Studio Worksheet](https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/resources/bonfireschool-design_studio.pdf) for the following exercises.**Session #1: On your own, sketch solutions to the design brief. Work quickly. You can use circles, squares, triangles or any shape you can imagine. Stop when you're done and we'll share with the group.****Session #2: Incorporate what you just learned from the group. Sketch ideas quickly again. Stop when you're done and we'll share with the group.*** * *### Short BreakGet up and move around. Drink some water. We'll start again in 10 minutes.* * *Design Studio, Continued------------------------Let's take another pass at communicating what we've learned. Maybe you had an inspiration during your break. Maybe you had a chance to chat with someone.**Session #3: On your own, sketch solutions to the design brief. Work quickly. You can use circles, squares, triangles or any shape you can imagine. Stop when you're done and we'll share with the group.**Now we will work as a group. **Session #4: Get a large post-it and draw your design together. Incorporate everything you've learned into this design. Stop when you're done and we'll share with the class.*** * *After we are done designing and telling stories, reflect on what you did one your own and as a group. What was surprising? What was difficult?Professional Context--------------------Starting with a problem, designing a solution and refining that idea are a large part of a designers job. Design skills help us see how we can use our knowledge of what people need and apply that to building something people can use.What kind of questions do you think we need to answer before building software? When do you think you can use what we learned in class? How can it be useful?Class Reflection----------------What worked and what would you change? Let's improve together.Recommended Reading-------------------*Learn to find human needs*- [Interviewing Users](http://www.portigal.com/Books/interviewing-users/) by Steve Portigal (2013)- [Rocket Surgery Made Easy](http://www.sensible.com/rsme.html) by Steve Krug (2010)*Design software*- [Lean UX](http://www.jeffgothelf.com/lean-ux-book/) by Jeff Gothelf with Josh Seiden (2013)- [The User’s Journey](http://www.donnalichaw.com/the-users-journey/) by Donna Lichaw (2016)- [Design Is a Job](https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job) by Mike Monteiro (2012)*Build software with Python*- [Think Python 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) – Green Tea Press- [Think Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025696.do) by Allen B Downey (2015) [Print Version]- [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3) - Python3 Compiler- [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) — Python 3 documentation---**Copyright 2017 Bonfire School****For use of curriculum, contact author [louis@bonfireschool.com](mailto:"louis@bonfireschool.com") for permission.**<img src="https://bonfireschool.github.io/classes/images/bonfireschool-logotype.svg" alt="alt text" width="160px" style="vertical-align:middle">
